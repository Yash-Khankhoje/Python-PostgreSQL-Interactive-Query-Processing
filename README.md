# Python-PostgreSQL-Interactive-Query-Processing
It help you to learn basic interactive querry processing of  PostgreSQL using Python

#First I assume the you must have installed postgreSQL on your OS. Here I am using Ubuntu so if you want to install it then plese refer the following link,
          https://computingforgeeks.com/install-postgrpip install psycopg2esql-12-on-ubuntu/
          
#First install 'psycopg2' library file using following command
      pip install psycopg2
Note:- If you are using pycharm then you can go to intrepreter setting and install the binary library file og psycopgto named as 'psycopg2-bin'.

#Then just using your terminal just create a postgreSQL user or use defaule user which is 'postgres'. If you have created a new user then you have to create a 
password for that user.

#Then create a database using that user.

#Then just use the above code and ,It will run fine.

#In the above code I have created two tables named as cars and players, so the above code will work only on those tables. You can pass n-numbers of queries on that.
